First GitHub repository (Tradition)

Hi humans,

I am Sneaky. I am learning to code in Angular. I wan to acquire new skills to not only remain competitive but to excel.
Hopefully it will help me pay my bills and to remain a proud developer.

Love is the greatest motivation, or was it jealousy?? Ahh, never mind.

I haven't learned Angular yet, neither I want to.

Today I am practicing git basics. Why? Well that's the cost of working in support project if you don't get chance to work in development often.
Wonder how I have been making update in this file on 25th of any month only. Hmmm. Something to ponder on.
