First GitHub repository (Tradition)

Hi humans,

I am Sneaky. I am learning to code in Angular. I wan to acquire new skills to not only remain competitive but to excel.
Hopefully it will help me pay my bills and to remain a proud developer.

Love is the greatest motivation, or was it jealousy?? Ahh, never mind.
